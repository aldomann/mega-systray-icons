# MEGAsync System Tray Icons

Custom systray icons for MEGAsync to fit the style of GNOME Shell when using [KStatusNotifierItem/AppIndicator Support](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) extension, although it should work with [TopIcons](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons/) as well.
## Installation

Simple, you just run the installation script from the root of the source folder:
```bash
./INSTALL
```

To restore the original icons, just run the uninstallation script from the root of the source folder:
```bash
./UNINSTALL
```
